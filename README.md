Below is an overview of the workflow. In order to run any of the scripts on your machine, you just need to edit `utils.py` to point the `data_dir` to the correct location, which on my Linux machines i
```
data_dir = '/drive/GoogleDrive/AMAAZE/Dissertation_YezziWoodley/Paper3_MoclanReplicationPaper/'
```

1. `loadppfiles.py`: This script loads the pp files and generates `finaldata_ridgelengths.csv` (not complete yet).
2. `process_VG_data.py`: This script takes as input a csv file generated by the virtual goniometer (VG), and transforms the data into a 2D python dictionary that allows easy access to the VG information by fragment name, and break number. The script saves the dictionary in the pkl file `break_curve_data.pkl` which can be used by other scripts.  Requires `finaldata_ridgelengths.csv` (where is this from?).
3. `mesh_stats.py`: This script computes statistics of each mesh directly from the 3D models and stores them in the file `mesh_stats.csv`.
4. `compute_break_data.py`: This script can be run after `process_VG_data.py` has been run. It reads in `break_curve_data.pkl`, generates statistics for each break, and prints the information out in a csv file called `break_level_data.csv`. It also includes manual data from the csv file `manual_break_level.csv` and requires `mesh_stats.csv`.
5. `frag_level_data.py`: This script compiles the fragment level data, from both `mesh_stats.csv` and the inventory file. Should generate file `frag_level_data.csv`.
6. `break_to_frag_level.py`: This script takes as input a csv file that is organized at the break level, so each row corresponds to a break. The script compiles fragemnt level summary statistics for all variables (see the scripts for the types of summary variables implemented), and prints out the fragment level information to the terminal. The usage is 
```
python break_to_frag_level.py > frag_data.csv
```

## Other scripts
We need to describe all other scripts:
1. `moclan.py`:
2. `moclan_modified.py`:
3. `frag_level_experiment.py`: This is an experiment that compares train/test splits at fragment level verus break level.
