1. `process_break_curve_data.py`: This script takes as input a csv file generated by the virtual goniometer (VG), and transforms the data into a 2D python dictionary that allows easy access to the VG information by fragment name, and break number. The script saves the dictionary in the pkl file `break_curve_data.pkl` which can be used by other scripts. 
2. `compute_stats.py`: This script can be run after `process_break_curve_data.py` has been run. It reads in `break_curve_data.pkl`, generates statistics for each break, and prints the information out in a csv file format. The usage is 
```
python compute_stats.py > VG_stats.csv
```
3. `loadppfiles.py`
4. `mesh_stats.py`
3. Merge break level data: `VG_stats.csv`, `manual_break_level.csv`
Need extra step to merge with Katrina's data. This a huge merge step. 
3. `break_to_frag_level.py`: This script takes as input a csv file that is organized at the break level, so each row corresponds to a break. The script compiles fragemnt level summary statistics for all variables (see the scripts for the types of summary variables implemented), and prints out the fragment level information to the terminal. The usage is 
```
python break_to_frag_level.py > frag_data.csv
```
Needs to be updated to include all break-level data.
4. `moclan_modified.py`:
5. `frag_level_experimenet.py`: This is an experiment that compares train/test splits at fragment level verus break level.
